I'm a software engineer who is passionate about open-source. I like experimenting with Kotlin especially multiplatform projects, here are some of my projects:

## Kotlin Compiler
* [KotlinCompilerPluginExample](https://github.com/Foso/KotlinCompilerPluginExample) (Kotlin JVM/JS/Native)

This is an example project that shows how to create a Kotlin Compiler Plugin.The plugin will print "Hello from" and the name of the file that is being compiled, as a compiler warning to the terminal log. 

* [MpApt](https://github.com/Foso/MpApt) (Kotlin JVM/JS/Native)

Kotlin Native/JS/JVM Annotation Processor library for Kotlin compiler plugins
